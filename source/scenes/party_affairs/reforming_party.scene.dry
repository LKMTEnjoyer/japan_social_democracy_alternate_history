= Reforming the Party

The JSP's 1955 platform declares the party to be a "class-based mass party", that is a party of the broad working masses, but with the proletariat at its core. In reality, the JSP is nothing but a husk with no mass membership that struggles to spread its message outside of the associated mass organisations. If we wish to turn the JSP into a true mass party, like our European socialist friends, we must pursue a thoroughgoing reform of our party organisation to realise this ideal.

- @peoples_party: We will become a people's party, though it is likely to be strongly opposed by leftists and centrists.
- @structural_reform: We should support the doctrine of 'structural reform', inspired by the Italian Communists!
- @mass_party: We should realise what our platform and constitution declare - we must become a class-based mass party in action, as well as words!
- @labour_reform: Perhaps a good compromise would be to become a party based on affiliate organisations, like the British Labour Party?
- @no_new_ideas: No, we will maintain the current organization.
- @root: Perhaps we can discuss this at a later time.
- @easy_discard

@peoples_party

Although this model for the party was rejected at reunification because of Leftist opposition, the Right of the JSP continues to urge for us to abandon our singular focus on the working class and seek to appeal to all walks of life and create a true national party of all the people.

The Left, and especially the Socialist Association, are naturally incensed by this betrayal of the compromise reached at reunification, however.

- @support_peoples_party: Yes, we must become a people's party!
- @build_support: We must build additional support before becoming a people's party.
- @support_peoples_party_hard: Despite strong opposition from the Center and Left factions, we will become a people's party.
- @root: Perhaps we can discuss this at a later time.

Within our party, we are pushing forward proposals for a people's party against the Left and Center

This reduces our reliance on funds from our affiliated unions, as our party is now a mass party with mass membership, similar to the JCP's model. 

In an emergency conference, we have decided to become a people's party that encompasses all of the regular people of Germany, not just the workers and urban poor. The Left and Center claim that our new party platform is a betrayal of our founding principles, a turn away from Marxism towards bourgeois opportunism. Whatever the case, we are now a party representing all of the people, not just the proletariat.

Should we run a new campaign to publicize our new platform?

It is an arduous and contentious process, but we have pushed through the proposal to become a people's party. The Left and Center claim that our new party platform is a betrayal of our founding principles, a turn away from Marxism towards bourgeois opportunism. Whatever the case, we are now a party representing all of the people, not just the proletariat.

Should we run a new campaign to publicize our new platform?

@campaign_workers
title: Campaign among the workers, to assuage their doubts about our changes.
on-arrival: workers_jsp += 6*(1-dissent);

The workers are still a key part of our constituency, and we must not alienate them in the transformation of our party.

@campaign_middle
title: Campaign among the middle classes.
on-arrival: old_middle_jsp += 5*(1-dissent); new_middle_jsp += 6*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent the employees and small businesspeople of the middle class, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_rural
title: Campaign in rural areas.
choose-if: rural_policy > 0
unavailable-subtitle: We have not enacted any rural policies yet.
on-arrival: rural_jsp += 7*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent farmers and rural workers as well, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_unemployed
title: Campaign among the unemployed.
on-arrival: unemployed_jsp += 6*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, the urban poor are still a key part of our constituency.

@campaign_women
title: Campaign among women of all classes.
on-arrival: workers_jsp += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_jsp += 3*(1-dissent); old_middle_jsp += 3*(1-dissent); rural_jsp += 3*(1-dissent); unemployed_jsp += 3*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, we represent women of all classes.

The Socialist Party has been and will always be a party of the working class.

@structural_reform

We will pursue a policy of structural reform. Sabur≈ç Eda is the primary supporter of this policy. This will increase our support from other classes without alienating our core voter base. The Center and Left factions do not oppose this as strongly as they oppose the concept of a people's party, but they still dislike it.

- @support_structural_reform: With enough support, we can start implementing the policy of structural reform.
- @build_structural_reform: We will campaign for this policy in our party.
- @root: Perhaps we can discuss this at a later time.

In an emergency conference, we have decided to reform our party so that it represents people from all walks of life, without neglecting our core voter base.

This reduces our reliance on funds from our affiliated unions, as our party is now a mass party with mass membership, similar to the JCP's model.

@mass_party

The issue with our organisation is that we do not put our money where our mouth is. We must take decisive action to turn our party into a genuinely mass party of the class-conscious proletariat by actively recruiting workers and the youth, instead of just enlisting trade union leaders for electoral campaigns.

This is essentially a declaration of war against the Right, who will oppose our efforts at every step, arguing this violates the compromise of 1955.

@labour_reform

The party has always held admiration for the mass character of the British Labour Party, achieved via affiliation by unions and other organisations. Perhaps we can broach the Left-Right divide by emulating this vision - emphasising the workers via trade unions, but also attracting mass organisations of other classes.

Both the Socialist Association and the Centre oppose this move however, as it merely circumvents the JSP's structural weaknesses, instead of turning it into a true mass party with a permanent staff.
